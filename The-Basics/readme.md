I already had a good Python base, so to reinforce it, I decided to tackle coding challenges on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

There are n sources to learn Python, don't choose too much, see which style suits you best, be it video, text, books, etc. If you like text with exercises, go to [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/).
