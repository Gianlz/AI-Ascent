I already had a good Python base, so to reinforce it, I decided to tackle coding challenges on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

There are n sources to learn Python, don't choose too much, see which style suits you best, be it video, text, books, etc. If you like text with exercises, go to [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/).

Also learn, OOP (Object Oriented Programming, how to use basic libraries such as (numpy, pandas, matplotlib), and the language conventions, in addition I recommend studying the basic data structures with arrays, lists (linked, circular linked, stacks...) and trees (Binary, AVL)
